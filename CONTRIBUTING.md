## Standards

   * Keep the code as simple and uncomplicated as possible.  Make it as easy as possible on Rust novices.  This is as much for my sake as for other contributors.  Of course, code sometimes is unavoidably complicated, but let's at least try to write our code in as straightforward a manner as possible.
   
   * Please document your code.  In this I'd have to encourage you to NOT follow my example.  I'm slowly trying to add explanatory comments, but haven't done a very good job of it in the past.
   
   * One practice of the Rust community that I have found particularly annoying is that when documenting methods and functions there is a strong tendency to rely on the `assert!()` macros when writing examples.  That practice caused me no end of confusion when I was first trying to learn the Rust language.  To be honest, I still find that convention to be particularly unhelpful and even counterproductive when I am trying to learn how to use a particular feature.  The choice is yours, of course, but please avoid relying on the `assert!()` macros in your documentation if possible.
