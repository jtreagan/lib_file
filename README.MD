# lib_file
File handling utility functions.
   
## Description
Not much more to say.  I wrote the functions in this crate to help with other projects on which I am working.

## Word of Caution
These functions tend to be weak on error handling.  My suggestion is to copy the code into your project and then modify from there.  Better than building from scratch.  I think.  Have fun!

## Good Intentions
You will find some of these functions documented with really nice examples.  The rest -- not so much.  I always have intended to go back and add examples to the rest of them, but well, you know, time sometimes just isn't there.  :>)
